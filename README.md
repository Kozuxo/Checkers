# Checkers
This is a IOS app game development project using swiftUI in XCode.

In this project, I made a "tron themed" checker game.
It's a simple game consisting of several circles and they can play each other. The player who eats all of the opposing player's circle is the winner.
You can promote your circle into king circle by keeping alive your circle to the latest lane of your enemy, the king circle can move backwards.

Here are my video demo of my app:
